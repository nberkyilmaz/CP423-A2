Text Processing and Query Handling

This project contains Python code for advanced text processing, specifically designed for creating and querying a TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) matrix. It's tailored for applications in information retrieval, text mining, and natural language processing tasks, where the goal is to efficiently search and rank documents based on their relevance to a given query.

Overview

The codebase provides a comprehensive approach to:

Construct a positional index of terms across a collection of documents.
Compute document frequencies for each term to understand their distribution across the corpus.
Apply various term frequency (TF) weighting schemes to account for term importance within documents.
Calculate inverse document frequencies (IDF) to measure how much information each term provides, based on its commonality across all documents.
Generate a TF-IDF matrix representing the importance of terms within documents, adjusted for their rarity across the corpus.
Query the document set, processing a given text query against the TF-IDF matrix to find and rank documents based on their relevance.
How It Works
Document Processing
Positional Index Construction: The system first builds a positional index from the input documents. This index maps each term to its positions within each document, facilitating efficient retrieval and relevance scoring.
Document Frequency Computation: For each term in the positional index, the document frequency (the number of documents containing the term) is computed. This metric is crucial for the IDF calculation.
TF-IDF Calculation
Term Frequency (TF) Calculation: The code supports multiple schemes for calculating the term frequency, including binary, raw count, term frequency, log normalization, and double normalization. This flexibility allows for fine-tuning the impact of term frequency on the overall relevance score.
Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) Calculation: IDF is calculated for each term to diminish the weight of terms that occur very frequently across the documents, hence offering little to no uniqueness or relevance.
TF-IDF Matrix Generation: A matrix is generated where each row corresponds to a document and each column to a term from the positional index. The matrix cells contain the TF-IDF score, representing the term's importance within a particular document adjusted by its document frequency.
Query Processing
Query Vectorization: The query text is preprocessed and transformed into a vector using the same TF-IDF calculation applied to documents. This allows for comparing the query directly against the document vectors in the TF-IDF matrix.
Cosine Similarity Calculation: The relevance of each document to the query is determined by calculating the cosine similarity between the document's TF-IDF vector and the query vector. Documents are then ranked based on their similarity scores.
Usage Example
An example usage scenario is provided, demonstrating how to read document data, preprocess it, generate a TF-IDF matrix, and query this matrix to retrieve and rank documents based on their relevance to a given query string.

Getting Started
To use this code for your text processing and querying tasks, you'll need to:

Ensure you have the necessary Python environment and dependencies set up (e.g., NumPy for matrix operations, NLTK for text preprocessing).
Place your document data in a suitable format for processing.
Adjust the example usage code to point to your data and queries.
Run the script to generate the TF-IDF matrix and query your documents.
